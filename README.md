# foodwaste

Analytical code for my food waste survey as part of my data journalism project

This project is dedicated to exploring the issue of food waste and all the Python code in the branch has been used for analysing and visualising the data gathered by myself using a Google Forms questionnaire. The types of visualisation used in the project include two donut charts, a word cloud, a treemap, a heatmap, a globe and others implemented using D3.js.
